# Customer Insights: Predicting Purchase Patterns with SQL



## Summary
In today's highly competitive e-commerce industry, understanding customer behaviour and predicting purchase patterns are crucial for businesses to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and boost sales. This report presents the findings of a data analysis project that utilized advanced SQL techniques to analyse a large dataset of customer transactions from an e-commerce company. The project aimed to identify key customer segments, analyse customer behaviour metrics, predict future purchase patterns, and provide recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Methodology
### - Data Collection: 
A dataset of transactional data from the e-commerce company was obtained, which included customer purchase details, product information, and order history.
### - Data Cleaning:
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
### - Data Integration:
Relevant data from multiple tables was integrated into a consolidated dataset using SQL joins and transformations, creating a unified view for analysis.
### - Data Analysis: 
Advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, stored procedures, and views, were used to perform data analysis tasks, such as customer segmentation, customer behaviour metrics analysis, and purchase pattern prediction.
### - Performance Optimization:
SQL queries were optimized for performance using indexing, query tuning techniques, and analysis of query execution plans, ensuring efficient and fast retrieval of data.

## Results and Findings
### - Customer Segmentation: 
Based on the analysis of customer transaction data, three key customer segments were identified: high-value customers, frequent buyers, and dormant customers. High-value customers contributed to a significant portion of the revenue, frequent buyers made frequent purchases with relatively lower values, and dormant customers showed infrequent or no purchase activity.
### - Customer Behaviour Metrics Analysis: 
Various customer behaviour metrics were calculated, including average order value, repeat purchase rate, and purchase frequency. The analysis revealed that high-value customers had the highest average order value and repeat purchase rate, while dormant customers had the lowest.
### - Purchase Pattern Prediction: 
Time-series analysis was performed to predict future purchase patterns. Seasonal trends and patterns in customer purchase behaviour were identified, which could be utilized to plan targeted marketing campaigns during peak seasons or offer personalized promotions to boost sales.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, the following recommendations were provided to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention:
### - Focus on high-value customers: 
Develop targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and personalized offers to retain and engage high-value customers, who contribute significantly to revenue.
### - Reactivate dormant customers: 
Implement strategies to re-engage dormant customers, such as offering special promotions or personalized incentives to encourage them to make purchases.
### - Optimize pricing and discounts: 
Analyse the impact of discounts on customer behaviour metrics and optimize pricing and discount strategies to maximize revenue and profitability.
### - Leverage seasonal trends:
Utilize the insights from the time-series analysis to plan marketing campaigns during peak seasons, such as holidays or special events, to capture increased customer demand.

## Conclusion:
The data analysis project using advanced SQL techniques provided valuable insights into customer behaviour and purchase patterns for the e-commerce company. The findings highlighted the importance of customer segmentation, customer behaviour metrics analysis, and purchase pattern prediction in optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer retention. The recommendations provided can help the company make data-driven decisions to enhance customer engagement, boost sales, and achieve business objectives.
